// RCLAnimationCurveDefault   - The default or inherited animation curve.
// RCLAnimationCurveEaseInOut - Begins the animation slowly, speeds up in the
//                              middle, and then slows to a stop.
// RCLAnimationCurveEaseIn    - Begins the animation slowly and speeds up to
//                              a stop.
// RCLAnimationCurveEaseOut   - Begins the animation quickly and slows down to
//                              a stop.
// RCLAnimationCurveLinear    - Animates with the same pace over the duration of
//                              the animation.
